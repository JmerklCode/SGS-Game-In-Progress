# SGS-Game-In-Progress
The script HUB for SGS games' game yet to be titled, also used as progress marker.
This game is made in The Unity Engine in C# with all written scripts available and usable to anyone who would like to,
however it should be noted that many of the scripts that in clude animations or sprites will not compile in the unity engine
when being integrated, unless the specific sprite or animation file names are changed to the ones that match your own.

Many of the values are modifyable within the game, however I have commented them anyways just in case you are working with a different
program, or are simply just wanting to explore the code a little more.

Thanks for checking it out!
